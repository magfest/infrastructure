                Besides the ribbons given out at registration, you may need your own ribbon type to help

                how many you'll need, and what color you'd like them to be. These ribbons will be given
                to you at the beginning of MAGFest to distribute to whoever needs them. (Note: Small orders
                of ribbons are very expensive - please request a ribbon type only if you need it, and tell
                us why you need it so we can make sure there's no duplication between departments.)
