                Signage comes in two types: 12"x18" coroplast and 24"x36" coroplast. All attendee-facing rooms will automatically 
                receive a 24"x36" coroplast for outside of the room.
                <br/><br/>Please submit requests for additional signage here, and be sure to specify FOR EACH SIGN:
                <br/>Number needed
                <br/>Size of sign
                <br/>Primary text of sign
                <br/>Sub text of sign (if applicable)
                <br/>Intended placement location for sign
                <br/>Link to any custom artwork that is needed
                <br/>Any additional notes
                <br/><br/>Note: This checklist item is NOT for printed materials such as sign-up forms, waivers, or anything else 
                that goes on standard office paper. STOPS has a paper cutter and a printer for small jobs (less than 50 pages). 
                Anything more than 50 pages needs to go into the Bulk Print Jobs checklist item.
