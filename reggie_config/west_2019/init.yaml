                An overwhelming majority of staffers want to work setup and teardown shifts rather than
                work during the event itself, so we have far more offers than we have need for. Since this
                affects what hotel nights staffers get, please approve and decline requests for this for
                people in your department. Please only approve staffers who will sign up for a setup or 
                teardown shift in your department.
